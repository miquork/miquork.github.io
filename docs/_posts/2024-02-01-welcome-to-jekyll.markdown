# Creating a new post

A new post is created by adding a new markdown file to `_posts` directory on your local branch and by pushing the newly made changes onto the remote `main` branch. This file works as a template. Make sure to add the line
```
{% raw %}{% include mathjax.html %}{% endraw %}
```
to your markdown file. The line is important for LaTex rendering.


# LaTex rendering

The following LaTex

$$
\begin{equation}
F(x)=\int f(x)dx
\end{equation}
$$

was created with

```
$$
\begin{equation}
F(x)=\int f(x)dx
\end{equation}
$$
```

For inline LaTex use `$...$`.

# Code snippets

````
```<desired programming language>
<insert code here (can be multiple lines)>
```
````

Example Python snippet

def main():
	print("Hello world!")
```
